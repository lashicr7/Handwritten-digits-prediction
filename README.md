# Handwritten-digits-prediction
- Trained a Convolutionary Neural Network(CNN) model with MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
- The dataset was preprocessed to normalize the images for better accuracy.
- To optimize the model’s performance,I experimented with different model architectures and also tuning of hyperparameters.
– Finally the model performed well on test data with high accuracy of 99% which I concluded from evaluation metrics (like accuracy score, confusion matrix heatmap).
